And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You&#39;re skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?</p><p>Search him. Then I will kill you.</p><p>But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.</p><p>Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.</p><p>You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.</p><p>It&#39;s not just your name, sir. It&#39;s your father&#39;s name. And it&#39;s all that&#39;s left of him. Don&#39;t destroy it.</p><p>There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes, the pit sends something back.</p><p>I&#39;m Batman</p><p>Just you, sir? Don&#39;t worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.</p><p>You see, I&#39;m a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.</p><p>How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.</p><p>You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.</p><p>The first time I stole so that I wouldn&#39;t starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.</p><p>I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality.</p>
