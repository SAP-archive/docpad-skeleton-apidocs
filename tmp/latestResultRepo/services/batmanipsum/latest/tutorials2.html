I&#39;m gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.</p><p>Falcone: No gun? I&#39;m insulted.</p><p>Joker: Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can&#39;t feel the next... See?</p><p>Ra&#39;s Al Ghul: Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You&#39;re skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?</p><p>Joker: You see, I&#39;m a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.</p><p>Batman: Swear to me!</p><p>Rachel: Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman I&#39;ll see him again.</p><p>Alfred: I&#39;m not sure you made it loud enough, sir.</p><p>Joker: Do I really look like a guy with a plan?</p><p>Alfred: The city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn&#39;t need your body or your life. That time is past.</p><p>Alfred: It&#39;s not just your name, sir. It&#39;s your father&#39;s name. And it&#39;s all that&#39;s left of him. Don&#39;t destroy it.</p><p>Ra&#39;s Al Ghul: You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.</p><p>Thomas Wayne: Gotham&#39;s been good to our family, but the city&#39;s been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center, Wayne tower.</p><p>Alfred: Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.</p>
