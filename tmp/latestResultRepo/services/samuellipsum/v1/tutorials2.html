This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they&#39;re actually proud of that shit.</p><p>Your bones don&#39;t break, mine do. That&#39;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don&#39;t get sick, I do. That&#39;s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We&#39;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p><p>My money&#39;s in that office, right <span class="u-help-label" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Samuel L.

If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain&#39;t there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I&#39;m gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I&#39;m gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I&#39;m talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p><p>Your bones don&#39;t break, mine do. That&#39;s clear.

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#39;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p><!-- please do not remove this line --><!-- end slipsum code -->
